# Tech Magazine

This was a 5-day group project to create a news website to browse the latest technology news with infinite scrolling. There are some functions missing (like the ability to load a different news category) due to the time limit, but we learnt a lot and used DockerHUB the first time.

Wireframing, logo and layout design was fully my part in the development.
